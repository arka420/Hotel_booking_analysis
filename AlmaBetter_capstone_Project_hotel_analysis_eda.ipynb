        "Hotel business is a lucrative yet very volatile business segment. It’s dependent on multiple criteria like type of hotel, business seasons, customer segments, multiple modes of booking, amenities, services and many more. Over the past couple of decades, it saw a massive surge in terms of profit, but then global pandemic hit worldwide and almost all industry sectors observed a deprivation in their business with ‘Hotel’ sector taking a major blow. This has made many entrepreneurs and business leaders realize how important it is to be strategic and leverage data analysis for making intelligent business decisions, thereby penetrating the market deep and gain more marketshares.\n",

        "By applying Exploratory Data Analysis principles and feature engineering, this study aims to explore merits of analysis on Hotels dataset that governs bookings and can help in increasing customer base. Secondary objective is to help the customers in deciding the best period to visit places while availing low accommodation cost benefits. In this project we were provided dataset containing booking information about two types of hotel and various other related booking criteria.\n",

        "First step of approach involved Data Exploration and Inspection over the raw data. Second step involved Data Cleaning by handling null values, dropping irrelevant columns and rows, parsing date in string to Datetime format and adding new feature columns that can help in better decision support. Final step involved performing a comprehensive data analysis over clean data to analyze the factors that affect hotel bookings and creating Data Visualization for the same. These factors can further helps in drawing booking, pricing and other correlated trends which can further aid in predicting business at high level.\n",

The aim of this analysis is to identify important features that can affect hotel bookings and help hotel businesses make intelligent decisions to penetrate the market and gain more market share. Additionally, the project seeks to help customers in deciding the best period to visit places while availing low accommodation cost benefits. The analysis will involve data exploration, data cleaning, and comprehensive data analysis to analyze the factors that influence hotel bookings and create data visualizations to identify booking and pricing trends. The project will be divided into three different types of analysis, namely univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis. Overall, the project's objective is to provide insights that will help the hotel industry make informed decisions to improve their business performance and customer satisfaction."
